            Hi! My name is Talhah Awan. I'm an aspiring software developer who likes to travel to new cities, find new music, all things fashion and photography, and playing rugby. I got into web development becuase I believe its the best mix of creativity and tech. My favorite city i've traveled to is London, i've been going there every year since I was about 2. My favorite type of music is rap with a jazz blend, usually known as acid rap. So far i've loved creating websites, so that should be a good sign, right?
